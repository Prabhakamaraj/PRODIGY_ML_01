# PRODIGY_ML_01
In this tutorial you will learn how to create Machine Learning Linear Regression Model. You will be analyzing a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. You will do Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions.
This project was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech under Task 01. The main objective is to build a simple machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict the price of houses based on:
The total square footage of the house
The number of bedrooms
The number of bathrooms
The dataset for this project was taken from the Kaggle competition House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.
Dataset used: train.csv from Kaggle
Target column: SalePrice (house price)
Features used for prediction:
GrLivArea – Living area in square feet
BedroomAbvGr – Number of bedrooms above ground
FullBath – Number of full bathrooms
